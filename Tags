✅ JIRA SUMMARY

Implementation of Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for Build and Deployment Process

⸻

✅ JIRA DETAILED DESCRIPTION

1. Objective

To implement a standardized Semantic Versioning (SemVer) model across all applications to maintain consistent version control, improve traceability, and streamline CI/CD deployments across AT, Preprod, and Production environments.

⸻

2. What is Semantic Versioning?

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) follows the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format:
	•	MAJOR – Breaking changes introduced
	•	MINOR – Backward-compatible features added
	•	PATCH – Backward-compatible bug fixes

Example: 1.4.7
	•	Major: 1
	•	Minor: 4
	•	Patch: 7

3. Problem Statement

Currently, build versions are generated inconsistently across environments. This leads to:
	•	Difficulty tracing which build is deployed where
	•	Issues during rollback due to mismatched build numbers
	•	Developers manually assigning versions differently
	•	No automation or validation for version increments

To resolve this, SemVer will be implemented across our CI/CD workflow.

4. Proposed Semantic Versioning Implementation

A. Version Storage
A central version.txt or Git tag-based version will be maintained in the repository.

B. Automated Version Bump Logic
Versioning will be controlled based on developer input or commit labels:
	•	major → increments MAJOR version
	•	minor → increments MINOR version
	•	patch → increments PATCH version

Example pipeline logic in Jenkins:
	•	Read current version from version.txt
	•	Auto-increment based on developer selection
	•	Commit the new version back to Git
	•	Use same version to create JAR and Docker image tags

⸻

C. Version Propagation to All Environments

The version created during AT build will be propagated to Preprod and Production without modification to ensure consistency.

Example:
AT build generates → 2.3.1
Same 2.3.1 is used for:
	•	UAT / AT deployment
	•	Preprod deployment
	•	Production deployment

No version re-creation in higher environments.

⸻

D. Benefits
	•	Consistent versioning across all environments
	•	Easy rollback with clear version traceability
	•	Automated version management through CI/CD
	•	Reduced manual errors
	•	Clear understanding of change severity (major/minor/patch)

⸻

5. Current Status
	•	Semantic versioning logic finalized
	•	Version bump script created
	•	Integrated with Jenkins pipeline
	•	Testing ongoing in AT environment
	•	Documentation prepared for team adoption

✅ WORKLOG COMMENT (R&D + IMPLEMENTATION – Ready to Paste)

Performed detailed R&D on implementing industry-standard Semantic Versioning (SemVer) across our CI/CD pipeline. Evaluated the current build/versioning inconsistencies and identified the need for a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning model.

Developed automated version bump logic in Jenkins to generate versions based on developer input using major/minor/patch rules. Implemented version persistence through version.txt and Git commits to maintain traceability. Integrated the Semantic version into the AT build pipeline and ensured the same version is propagated to Preprod and Production deployments.

Validated multiple deployment scenarios and confirmed that version consistency resolves rollback issues and improves release tracking. Prepared documentation and guidelines for the development team to adopt the SemVer process. Ongoing testing in AT environment before rollout to higher environments.
