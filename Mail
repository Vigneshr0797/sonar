Subject: Discussion Required on Jira Project Flow and Ticket Creation Process

Dear Linda and Revathi,

I would like to bring to your attention some concerns regarding the Jira project flow and the ticket creation process in the ISE project. Currently, developers are creating deployment tickets in different formats each time, which is causing inconsistencies and confusion.

To streamline the process and ensure uniformity, I request that we discuss this and finalize a standard approach for ticket creation.

Please let me know your availability so that we can schedule a discussion at your convenience.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also prepare a more detailed escalation mail or suggest a standard deployment ticket template.
