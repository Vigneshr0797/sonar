Here is your simplified, professional, and cleanly formatted experience section with Terraform and Ansible added:

⸻

Updated & Simplified Experience Section (with Terraform + Ansible)

• Designed and implemented end-to-end CI/CD pipelines, improving deployment speed and reducing manual activities across all environments.
• Automated key operational tasks using Shell, Groovy, and Python scripts for deployments, log analysis, and code comparisons.
• Provisioned and optimized AWS infrastructure (EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, DocumentDB) to deliver secure and cost-efficient environments.
• Automated infrastructure creation and updates using Terraform, enabling consistent, version-controlled, and repeatable environment provisioning.
• Implemented Ansible-based configuration management to automate server setup, package installations, hardening, and Kubernetes node configuration.
• Deployed containerized microservices using Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm for scalable and consistent application rollouts.
• Implemented centralized monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and CloudWatch for complete system observability.
• Integrated SonarQube and Nexus to enforce DevSecOps practices, ensuring continuous code quality and secure dependency management.
• Optimized database performance across RDS, DynamoDB, and DocumentDB through advanced tuning and configuration.
• Strengthened cloud security by configuring IAM policies, Secrets Manager, and KMS for controlled and encrypted access.
• Led the migration from monolithic applications to microservices to improve scalability, modularity, and resilience.
• Integrated TruffleHog for secret detection and Trivy for vulnerability scanning to ensure secure pipelines and image integrity.

If you want, I can update this directly inside your resume PDF and generate a new polished version.




Here is your refined, simplified version including Ansible and Terraform points, with clear, crisp DevOps wording:

⸻

• Designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines for Spring Boot microservices, enabling smooth integration and automated deployments.
• Maintained Git version control for seamless collaboration across developers and operations teams.
• Automated build, test, and deployment workflows using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and integrated JFrog Artifactory for efficient artifact management.
• Deployed applications on Kubernetes clusters using Helm charts for consistent and scalable configuration management.
• Managed high availability and scaling using Kubernetes HPA and Ingress Controller for load distribution and traffic routing.
• Implemented centralized logging and monitoring with Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana to ensure full observability and faster issue resolution.
• Integrated SonarQube for static code analysis to maintain code quality, security, and compliance.
• Configured Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for reliable storage and logging across microservices.
• Managed on-premises Kubernetes infrastructure, including load balancing, autoscaling, networking, and service mesh integration.
• Secured workloads using Kubernetes Secrets, RBAC, and Network Policies to restrict unauthorized access.
• Optimized Jenkins pipelines using shared libraries, parallel stages, and webhook triggers for efficient, event-driven deployments.
• Automated server configuration, deployments, and environment provisioning using Ansible for consistent and repeatable setups.
• Provisioned and managed cloud/on-prem infrastructure using Terraform, enabling Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with version-controlled, reusable modules.

Let me know if you want this converted into a resume bullet section, ATS format, or professional summary!

Here is an ATS-optimized, keyword-rich, professionally rewritten version of both project sections.
All bullets now include strong DevOps, Kubernetes, CI/CD, IaC, Cloud, Security, and Automation keywords that ATS systems look for.

⸻

🔹 D2C Project – ATS-Optimized Version

• Developed and optimized Jenkins CI/CD pipelines with JIRA integration for automated builds, deployments, audit logs, and end-to-end traceability.
• Deployed Dockerized Node.js, Angular, and Python microservices to AWS EKS using Helm charts for consistent, scalable deployments.
• Implemented centralized monitoring and logging using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Promtail, improving observability and incident response.
• Integrated Trivy and TruffleHog into CI workflows for container vulnerability scanning and secret detection, enhancing security compliance.
• Automated server configuration, application deployment, and environment provisioning using Ansible, ensuring repeatable and reliable operations.
• Provisioned and managed AWS infrastructure, including EKS clusters, VPC components, and networking using Terraform with reusable IaC modules.

⸻

🔹 ESB Spring Boot Project – ATS-Optimized Version

• Installed, configured, and managed Kubernetes clusters to support high-availability Spring Boot microservices and production-grade workloads.
• Built CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitLab, automating build, test, security scans, and multi-environment deployments.
• Containerized Spring Boot applications with Docker and deployed them using Helm for consistent configuration and rollout strategies.
• Integrated SonarQube for code quality, coverage, and security checks; managed secure image storage and CI image workflows using Harbor.
• Implemented GitOps workflows with ArgoCD, enabling automated deployments, rollback mechanisms, and declarative environment sync.
• Optimized Kubernetes resources, including HPA, resource limits, secrets, config maps, and node allocations for reliability and performance.
• Automated JIRA workflows and connected them with Jenkins to enable deployment tracking, ticket updates, and reduced manual operations.
• Used Ansible to automate cluster setup, configuration management, service deployments, and operational tasks across environments.
• Provisioned and managed on-prem and cloud infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring consistent, version-controlled, and scalable IaC deployments.

If you want, I can also:
✅ Merge both into one “Project Experience” section
✅ Convert them into achievement-based bullet points with metrics
✅ Format them for your resume layout or LinkedIn profile

Just tell me what you prefer!
